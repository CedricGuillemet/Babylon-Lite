# MeshLoD Requirements

> Approved source: `docs/lite/architecture/mesh-lod/goals.md`
>
> This document defines verifiable product requirements for the initial MeshLoD deliverable. It intentionally does not define implementation tasks or final public API signatures.

## 1. Scope and Terminology

- **MeshLoD asset**: a versioned `.mlod` sidecar containing one clustered LOD hierarchy and its paged geometry.
- **Cluster / meshlet**: a bounded unit of geometry selected as part of a hierarchy cut.
- **Group**: a hierarchy transition unit whose replacement geometry becomes visible atomically.
- **Coarse representation**: the pinned, always-renderable ancestor geometry loaded before fine-detail streaming.
- **Resident page**: a geometry page whose data is available for the current runtime stage.
- **CPU oracle**: the deterministic reference selector used to establish correctness before GPU selection is accepted.
- **Compatible render batch**: selected geometry that can share the same material-owned rendering configuration and hierarchy submission.

## 2. Naming and Deliverables

### REQ-NAME-1 — Feature name

The feature, public documentation, standalone demo, offline tool, diagnostics, and asset format MUST use the name **MeshLoD**.

**Acceptance criteria**

- User-visible names use `MeshLoD`.
- Third-party product names are not used as the Babylon Lite feature name.

### REQ-NAME-2 — Offline tool location

The offline converter MUST be rooted at `mesh-lod-tool\`.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A clean repository checkout can configure the converter with `cmake -S mesh-lod-tool -B mesh-lod-tool/build`.
- The converter does not require source files outside the declared tool root except repository inputs supplied by path.

### REQ-NAME-3 — Initial end-to-end asset

The first end-to-end conversion and demo asset MUST be the repository-root file `harvard-yenching_institute_statue.glb`.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The documented conversion workflow accepts that file as input.
- The standalone demo loads its generated `.mlod` output through the same public, lazy runtime path intended for applications.

### REQ-NAME-4 — Required deliverables

The initial feature MUST include an offline converter, a versioned `.mlod` asset contract, an opt-in Babylon Lite engine feature, and a standalone Babylon Lite demo.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Each deliverable is independently identifiable in repository documentation.
- The demo depends on the engine feature rather than a demo-only rendering path.

## 3. Offline Converter

### REQ-TOOL-1 — Build system

The converter MUST build with CMake.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Configuration and release builds succeed from a clean checkout using documented commands.
- Documentation covers Windows single-config and multi-config generator invocation and executable locations.

### REQ-TOOL-2 — Pinned dependencies

CMake MUST use `FetchContent` to acquire pinned revisions of **meshoptimizer** and **cgltf**.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Dependency revisions are immutable identifiers rather than floating branches or unpinned tags.
- Reconfiguring with the same inputs resolves the same dependency revisions.

### REQ-TOOL-3 — glTF ingestion

The converter MUST use cgltf to read both glTF and GLB input.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Valid supported `.gltf` and `.glb` fixtures produce equivalent normalized primitive inputs.
- Malformed container, JSON, buffer, buffer-view, or accessor data produces an explicit failure.

### REQ-TOOL-4 — MeshLoD generation

The converter MUST use meshoptimizer's clustered LOD and meshlet capabilities to produce hierarchy and geometry payloads.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Output metadata reports non-zero groups, meshlets, and triangles for the statue asset.
- Every emitted meshlet and hierarchy relationship passes converter validation.

### REQ-TOOL-5 — Non-interactive CLI

The converter MUST provide a non-interactive command-line interface accepting input and output paths plus explicit conversion options.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The expected workflow can run without prompts.
- Missing, invalid, or conflicting arguments return a non-zero exit code and identify the offending argument.
- `--help` documents every supported option and its default.

### REQ-TOOL-6 — Version reporting

The converter MUST expose its tool version, `.mlod` format version, and pinned dependency revisions through `--version`.

**Acceptance criteria**

- `--version` is machine-invocable without an input asset.
- Reported values match the metadata written by the same tool build.

### REQ-TOOL-7 — Deterministic conversion

The converter MUST produce byte-identical `.mlod` output for identical input bytes, explicit options, dependency revisions, tool version, and target format version.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Two clean conversions under the same supported environment compare byte-for-byte equal.
- Output ordering and metadata contain no timestamps, random values, unstable paths, or other nondeterministic fields.

### REQ-TOOL-8 — Validation and statistics

The converter MUST validate its output and report useful statistics for groups, meshlets, source and output triangles, hierarchy depth, bounds, simplification errors, and page layout.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Validation runs before a conversion is reported successful.
- Invalid hierarchy references, invalid bounds, non-finite errors, and out-of-range payload references fail conversion.
- Statistics are available in a non-interactive form suitable for automated verification.

### REQ-TOOL-9 — Failure behavior

The converter MUST return a non-zero exit code and a precise diagnostic for unsupported primitive modes, unsupported compression extensions, unsupported accessor/component layouts, malformed accessors, invalid hierarchy output, and file I/O failures.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A fixture exists for every listed failure class.
- No listed failure produces a successful or partially valid output.
- Diagnostics identify the source primitive or data location when that information is available.

## 4. Supported Source Geometry

### REQ-GEO-1 — Initial geometry scope

The initial converter MUST support static, opaque glTF triangle primitives with a required `POSITION` attribute.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Supported `TRIANGLES` primitives convert successfully.
- Non-triangle primitive modes fail explicitly.
- Skinned, morphed, alpha-blended, and transmissive primitives are rejected as unsupported in the initial version.

### REQ-GEO-2 — Index handling

The converter MUST accept indexed and unindexed supported primitives and MUST index unindexed input during preprocessing.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Equivalent indexed and unindexed fixtures preserve equivalent visible geometry.
- Emitted geometry uses valid indices within the emitted vertex range.

### REQ-GEO-3 — Vertex attributes

The initial output MUST preserve position, normal, and UV data required by the statue demo. Missing normals MUST be generated offline. `TEXCOORD_0` MAY be absent only when the primitive's material does not require it.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A supported primitive without normals converts with valid finite generated normals.
- A textured material without required UVs fails explicitly.
- A material that does not require UVs can convert without `TEXCOORD_0`.

### REQ-GEO-4 — Unsupported encodings

Unsupported compressed source primitives and unsupported accessor or component layouts MUST fail with a precise converter error.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Unsupported compression is never silently decoded incorrectly, ignored, or passed through.
- The error identifies the unsupported extension or accessor layout.

### REQ-GEO-5 — Hierarchy coordinate space

Each hierarchy MUST be built in primitive-local space. Normal glTF node and scene world transforms MUST remain runtime state.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Multiple instances with different world transforms can share one immutable hierarchy.
- Selection and bounds remain correct after applying each instance's runtime transform.

### REQ-GEO-6 — Material boundaries

Each glTF material primitive MUST be converted independently, and simplification MUST NOT cross a material boundary.

**Acceptance criteria**

- No emitted group or meshlet combines triangles from different source material primitives.
- Material assignment remains stable across all hierarchy levels.

### REQ-GEO-7 — Crack-free hierarchy contract

Every valid rendered cut MUST cover each source surface region at exactly one hierarchy resolution. Shared group boundaries MUST be protected, and a refinement MUST become visible only when its complete replacement group is resident.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Deterministic cut fixtures contain no missing or duplicate hierarchy regions.
- Partial residency cannot expose only part of a replacement group.

## 5. `.mlod` Asset Contract

### REQ-FMT-1 — Initial container model

The initial format MUST be a single versioned, range-addressable `.mlod` binary container per converted glTF primitive hierarchy.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A hierarchy does not require one file per meshlet.
- Multi-pack output is not required by the initial reader or converter.
- The reader rejects unsupported format versions explicitly.

### REQ-FMT-2 — HTTP serving contract

The `.mlod` container MUST be usable when served with `Content-Encoding: identity` and HTTP byte-range support.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The runtime can load metadata, coarse pages, and selected fine pages using byte ranges.
- Documentation states that content transformation or compression by intermediaries is incompatible unless byte offsets are preserved.

### REQ-FMT-3 — Bootstrap layout

Resident hierarchy metadata and pinned coarse pages MUST occupy known ranges near the beginning of the container.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The runtime can discover all ranges required for initial coarse rendering without downloading fine-detail pages.
- The initial coarse representation is renderable before optional fine pages complete.

### REQ-FMT-4 — Streamed page size

Streamed geometry MUST be organized into independently decodable pages between 64 KiB and 256 KiB, with each page containing multiple meshlets where the hierarchy permits.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Converter validation rejects streamed pages outside the allowed range.
- Decoding one page does not require fetching an unrelated fine-detail page.

### REQ-FMT-5 — Self-description and provenance

The container metadata MUST identify the format version, tool version, pinned dependency revisions, conversion options that affect output, hierarchy counts, and byte ranges required by the reader.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Runtime compatibility can be determined before interpreting unsupported payload data.
- Conversion provenance can be compared with `mesh-lod-tool --version`.

### REQ-FMT-6 — Integrity and compatibility failures

Corrupt, truncated, unsupported, or version-incompatible `.mlod` inputs MUST fail explicitly rather than producing partial success or silent format fallback.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Corruption, truncation, invalid offsets, overlapping or out-of-bounds ranges, invalid hierarchy references, and unsupported versions have deterministic error fixtures.
- A failed asset never becomes registered as successfully loaded.

### REQ-FMT-7 — Full-response range fallback

If a server ignores a valid range request and returns HTTP 200 with the complete file, the loader MAY retain and use that complete response. Other range or protocol failures MUST be surfaced explicitly.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A complete HTTP 200 response can satisfy subsequent range reads without repeated downloads.
- Invalid partial responses, mismatched lengths, and unusable status codes fail with explicit diagnostics.

## 6. Runtime Loading and Lifecycle

### REQ-LOAD-1 — Coarse-first loading

The runtime MUST load and validate resident hierarchy metadata and pinned coarse pages before requesting optional fine-detail pages.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A successfully initialized asset can render a complete coarse representation with fine streaming disabled.
- Fine-page requests do not block availability of the validated coarse representation.

### REQ-LOAD-2 — Explicit budgets

The runtime MUST require or provide explicit, observable limits for page-cache bytes and concurrent fetches.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Effective limits are available to diagnostics.
- Invalid limits fail before streaming begins.

### REQ-LOAD-3 — Disposal

Disposing a MeshLoD asset MUST abort its outstanding requests, unregister its scene-owned work, and release its CPU and GPU cache allocations when they are no longer shared.

**Acceptance criteria**

- No request completion mutates a disposed asset.
- Repeated disposal is safe.
- Resource accounting returns to the expected shared baseline.

### REQ-LOAD-4 — Device loss

After WebGPU device loss, the runtime MUST recreate resident GPU state from retained metadata and CPU page data or by deterministic re-fetch, while preserving a valid coarse fallback.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A device-loss fixture restores rendering without reconverting the source asset.
- Resources are replaced make-before-break whenever an old device resource remains usable during replacement.
- Terminal recovery failure is reported explicitly and does not expose raw GPU objects.

## 7. Selection Correctness

### REQ-SEL-1 — CPU oracle first

A deterministic CPU selector MUST be completed and accepted as the correctness oracle before GPU selection is considered conformant.

**Acceptance criteria**

- CPU fixtures cover camera, projection, error threshold, hierarchy, and residency inputs.
- Each fixture has a stable expected ordered set of selected cluster IDs.

### REQ-SEL-2 — GPU equivalence

GPU selection MUST return the same cluster IDs as the CPU oracle for deterministic camera, error, hierarchy, culling, and residency fixtures.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Automated comparisons report no missing, extra, or duplicate cluster IDs.
- Ordering differences are permitted only if ordering is declared semantically irrelevant and normalized by the test.

### REQ-SEL-3 — Screen-space error

Selection MUST use camera position, projection, and a configurable screen-space error threshold, and the selected cut MUST respect that threshold subject to residency fallback.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Fully resident fixtures refine when projected error exceeds the threshold and stop refining when it does not.
- When required fine data is absent, the nearest resident ancestor is selected and the unmet error is observable.

### REQ-SEL-4 — Frustum culling

Selection MUST exclude clusters outside the camera frustum without removing hierarchy coverage needed by visible regions.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Fully outside fixtures select no renderable clusters.
- Boundary-intersecting fixtures remain visible.

### REQ-SEL-5 — Selection hysteresis

Selection MUST apply explicit LOD hysteresis so small camera movement near a threshold does not repeatedly change the selected cut.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A deterministic camera-jitter fixture remains on a stable cut inside the hysteresis band.
- Crossing the configured refinement or coarsening boundary causes the expected transition.

### REQ-SEL-6 — Atomic refinement

A group MUST refine only after all geometry required for its transition is resident.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Incomplete replacement residency keeps the nearest complete resident ancestor visible.
- Completion switches the group without a frame containing a hole or mixed partial replacement.

### REQ-SEL-7 — Coarse fallback

The runtime MUST preserve a complete coarse renderable fallback at all times after successful initialization.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Delayed, cancelled, failed, retried, or evicted fine-detail requests never create visible holes.
- The last resident coarse representation cannot be evicted.

## 8. Streaming and Cache Management

### REQ-STREAM-1 — Range-based page requests

Fine geometry MUST be requestable as independently useful byte ranges from the single `.mlod` container.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Camera movement can request a subset of fine pages without downloading the full container.
- Requested ranges correspond to container metadata.

### REQ-STREAM-2 — Bounded concurrency

Streaming MUST enforce a configurable upper bound on simultaneous page requests.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Stress fixtures never exceed the configured in-flight request count.
- Reducing the bound affects scheduling without breaking coarse rendering.

### REQ-STREAM-3 — Request deduplication

Concurrent demand for the same page MUST share one in-flight request.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Repeated demand produces one network transfer and one committed page result.
- All current consumers observe the same terminal success or failure.

### REQ-STREAM-4 — Cancellation

Requests that are no longer useful because of camera movement or asset disposal MUST be cancellable.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Obsolete queued requests do not start.
- Obsolete in-flight requests are aborted when safe and do not become resident solely because a stale completion races cancellation.

### REQ-STREAM-5 — Prioritization

The scheduler MUST prioritize page requests by visible screen-space benefit relative to transfer cost.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Given a deterministic pending set, pages with higher configured benefit-to-cost priority start first.
- Invisible work cannot indefinitely block visible coarse-to-fine improvement.

### REQ-STREAM-6 — Retry policy

Retries MUST follow an explicit bounded policy. Terminal failures MUST be reported while rendering continues from the nearest resident ancestor.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Retry count and delay are bounded and observable.
- Permanent failures stop retrying.
- Failure of a fine page does not remove valid resident fallback geometry.

### REQ-CACHE-1 — Byte budget

The GPU page cache MUST remain within its configured byte budget except for at most one page currently being uploaded.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Accounting includes resident fine pages and pinned coarse pages.
- Stress fixtures exceed the budget only by the byte size of at most one active upload.
- The cache returns within budget after the upload commits or fails.

### REQ-CACHE-2 — Minimum viable budget

Pinned coarse pages MUST count toward the cache budget and MUST fit within the configured minimum viable budget.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Initialization fails explicitly when the budget cannot hold all required pinned coarse pages.
- Coarse pages remain pinned after successful initialization.

### REQ-CACHE-3 — Safe eviction

The cache MUST evict only unpinned pages that are not in flight and are not required by the current submitted frame.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Eviction stress fixtures never invalidate geometry referenced by the current frame.
- Pinned coarse pages and in-flight pages are never selected as eviction victims.

### REQ-CACHE-4 — Residency hysteresis

Cache and request scheduling MUST apply explicit residency hysteresis to avoid repeated request and eviction thrashing.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A deterministic camera-jitter fixture does not repeatedly fetch and evict the same page inside the hysteresis policy.
- Sustained demand eventually makes the page eligible for retention or re-request according to the documented policy.

## 9. Rendering and Materials

### REQ-RENDER-1 — Hardware rasterization

The initial MeshLoD renderer MUST use WebGPU hardware rasterization.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The initial path does not depend on software rasterization or a visibility-buffer renderer.

### REQ-RENDER-2 — No CPU draw per meshlet

The renderer MUST NOT submit one CPU draw call per selected meshlet.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Draw submission count does not scale one-for-one with selected meshlet count.
- The initial target is one indirect draw per compatible material/hierarchy render batch.

### REQ-RENDER-3 — Material ownership

Materials MUST continue to own shader source, pipeline descriptors, bind-group layout, and bind-group creation for MeshLoD rendering.

**Acceptance criteria**

- MeshLoD uses material-owned renderable or vertex-processing variants.
- The generic renderer does not introduce a MeshLoD-owned public shader path.
- Different compatible opaque materials retain their own rendering behavior.

### REQ-RENDER-4 — Frame-safe resource replacement

GPU buffer and cache replacement MUST use make-before-break retirement and MUST not destroy resources still referenced by submitted work.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Upload, eviction, and device-recovery tests do not reuse or destroy resources before their last submitted frame is safe.

## 10. Babylon Lite Integration

### REQ-INT-1 — Opt-in and tree-shakable

MeshLoD MUST be an opt-in, tree-shakable engine feature with no runtime cost or fetched MeshLoD code for scenes that do not enable it.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Existing non-MeshLoD scenes fetch no MeshLoD runtime chunks.
- Existing bundle-size ceilings continue to pass.
- Importing unrelated Babylon Lite entry points does not initialize MeshLoD state.

### REQ-INT-2 — Lazy extension integration

Loading and rendering integration MUST use lazy, opt-in extension seams rather than hardcoded eager feature logic in core loader or renderer paths.

**Acceptance criteria**

- MeshLoD runtime modules load only after an application explicitly selects the feature or a MeshLoD asset path.
- Non-MeshLoD glTF loading behavior and fetched chunks remain unchanged.

### REQ-INT-3 — Pure public state

Public MeshLoD objects MUST be pure state, with behavior supplied by standalone functions.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Public state interfaces expose no attached behavior methods.
- Unused standalone behavior can be tree-shaken.

### REQ-INT-4 — One-way ownership

MeshLoD objects MUST NOT hold scene references. The scene MUST own registered renderables and lifecycle callbacks.

**Acceptance criteria**

- One MeshLoD hierarchy can be instantiated without embedding a scene in its asset state.
- Removing an instance unregisters scene-owned work without mutating unrelated instances.

### REQ-INT-5 — No raw GPU public API

No public MeshLoD API MUST expose raw WebGPU handles, including `GPUDevice`, `GPUBuffer`, `GPUTexture`, `GPUTextureView`, or `GPUSampler`.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Public declaration review contains none of the prohibited handle types.
- Diagnostics expose values and identifiers rather than raw handles.

### REQ-INT-6 — No import-time side effects

MeshLoD modules MUST have no import-time registration, global mutation, or eager module-level collection allocation.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Importing a MeshLoD module without calling it creates no runtime registration or cache.
- Caches initialize lazily and are isolated or invalidated across device changes.

### REQ-INT-7 — Shared hierarchy instances

Multiple runtime instances MAY share one immutable primitive-local hierarchy while retaining independent transforms, visibility, selection state where required, and scene ownership.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Two differently transformed instances render correctly from one hierarchy payload.
- Disposing one instance does not invalidate another live instance.

### REQ-INT-8 — Existing behavior preservation

Introducing MeshLoD MUST preserve existing Babylon Lite scene behavior, visual parity, loader behavior, lifecycle behavior, and bundle-size guarantees when the feature is unused.

**Acceptance criteria**

- All agent-allowed existing build, parity, and bundle-size checks remain green when engine implementation is introduced.
- No existing golden reference or bundle ceiling is changed to accommodate MeshLoD.

## 11. Standalone Demo

### REQ-DEMO-1 — Babylon Lite standalone conventions

The MeshLoD demo MUST follow current Babylon Lite standalone demo conventions: a standalone WebGPU page, production-bundled demo entry, gallery metadata, loading/progress presentation, ready/error signaling, and a JPG gallery thumbnail.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The demo is discoverable from the existing demo gallery.
- The page reports loading progress or an indeterminate loading state and hides the overlay on ready or error.
- The page renders the same tree-shaken artifact measured by demo bundle tooling.

### REQ-DEMO-2 — Application-equivalent loading

The demo MUST load the statue `.mlod` through the same public and lazy path intended for applications.

**Acceptance criteria**

- No demo-only loader, selector, cache, or renderer bypass is used.
- Disabling or removing the MeshLoD opt-in prevents the MeshLoD runtime chunk from loading.

### REQ-DEMO-3 — Camera behavior

The demo MUST provide orbit and zoom controls and SHOULD provide an optional deterministic camera path for repeatable observation.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A user can orbit and zoom around the statue.
- If enabled, the deterministic path produces repeatable camera state over time and can be disabled for manual control.

### REQ-DEMO-4 — Runtime controls

The demo MUST provide controls for screen-space error, cache budget, streaming pause, simulated bandwidth, and simulated latency.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Control changes expose their effective values.
- Streaming pause stops new fine-detail progress without removing the coarse fallback.
- Bandwidth and latency simulation affects MeshLoD page traffic rather than unrelated page resources.

### REQ-DEMO-5 — Diagnostics

The demo MUST make source triangle count, rendered triangle count, selected meshlet count, hierarchy depth, effective screen-space error, page requests, page residency, downloaded bytes, cache use, and GPU timing observable.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Values update while the camera, threshold, and streaming state change.
- Unsupported GPU timing capability is identified explicitly rather than displayed as a valid zero.
- Downloaded-byte and cache-use values have documented units.

### REQ-DEMO-6 — Debug views

The demo MUST provide debug views for meshlet ID, LOD depth, selected group, page residency, and requested pages.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Each view can be enabled without changing the hierarchy or streaming correctness.
- The active view and legend or value interpretation are visible to the user.

### REQ-DEMO-7 — Coarse fallback demonstration

The demo MUST visibly demonstrate uninterrupted coarse fallback while fine pages are delayed, paused, unavailable, or terminally failed.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The statue remains completely represented during each simulated condition.
- Diagnostics identify the fallback depth and failed or pending pages.

## 12. Verification Requirements

### REQ-VERIFY-1 — Converter fixtures

Automated converter verification MUST cover deterministic output, supported GLB/glTF ingestion, indexed and unindexed geometry, missing-normal generation, metadata/statistics, and every required failure class.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The converter test inventory maps each listed behavior and failure class to at least one passing fixture.

### REQ-VERIFY-2 — Format fixtures

Automated format verification MUST cover bootstrap ranges, page boundaries, version compatibility, invalid offsets, corruption, truncation, full-file HTTP 200 handling, and invalid partial responses.

**Acceptance criteria**

- The format test inventory maps each listed protocol and validation case to at least one passing fixture.

### REQ-VERIFY-3 — Selection fixtures

Automated deterministic fixtures MUST compare CPU and GPU cluster IDs across threshold boundaries, frustum boundaries, incomplete residency, hysteresis, and multiple transformed instances.

**Acceptance criteria**

- All fixture comparisons pass without missing, extra, or duplicate normalized cluster IDs.

### REQ-VERIFY-4 — Streaming and cache fixtures

Automated deterministic fixtures MUST verify concurrency bounds, deduplication, cancellation, priority ordering, bounded retries, cache accounting, pinned pages, frame-safe eviction, and residency hysteresis.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Instrumented tests demonstrate every listed bound and lifecycle invariant under both success and failure.

### REQ-VERIFY-5 — Integration verification

Verification MUST prove that non-MeshLoD scenes fetch no MeshLoD chunks and retain existing visual parity and bundle-size compliance.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Applicable existing parity and bundle checks pass with no MeshLoD chunk in non-MeshLoD runtime fetch logs.

### REQ-VERIFY-6 — Demo verification

The standalone demo MUST be manually or automatically verifiable for every required control, diagnostic, debug view, fallback scenario, and ready/error state.

**Acceptance criteria**

- A verification checklist or automated suite records a passing result for every `REQ-DEMO-*` requirement.

## 13. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for the initial MeshLoD deliverable:

- Skinned meshes.
- Morphed meshes.
- Alpha-blended or transmissive materials.
- Simplification across material boundaries.
- Software rasterization.
- Visibility-buffer rendering.
- Browser-side hierarchy generation.
- A general-purpose asset conversion UI.
- One-file-per-meshlet output.
- Multi-pack output.
- Service-worker-specific caching policies.
- Raising existing bundle-size ceilings.
- Changing existing golden reference images.

## 14. Open Decisions

These decisions are not resolved by the approved goals and require user approval before architecture or implementation is finalized:

1. **Multi-primitive output naming:** whether one CLI `--output` path creates exactly one primitive container, a deterministic set of sibling `.mlod` files, or rejects inputs selecting more than one primitive.
2. **Binary compatibility details:** initial format version number, byte order, alignment, checksum/integrity mechanism, and forward-compatible optional-section rules.
3. **Page boundary exception:** whether the final streamed page may be smaller than 64 KiB or must be padded/combined.
4. **Default policies:** default screen-space error, LOD/residency hysteresis bands, cache budget, fetch concurrency, retry count/backoff, and simulated demo network values.
5. **Material support boundary:** the exact set of opaque Babylon Lite material features and texture combinations guaranteed in the initial renderer beyond the statue's needs.
6. **Runtime request customization:** whether applications must be able to supply request headers, credentials, a custom fetch function, or external cache integration.
7. **GPU timing fallback:** whether unavailable timestamp queries should hide the metric, show CPU timing, or report only “unsupported.”
8. **Deterministic camera path:** the exact path, duration, looping behavior, and whether it is required for automated demo verification.
